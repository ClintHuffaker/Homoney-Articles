# ASPM and API Security: Complementarity at its Finest

Complementarity is a word not often heard outside Quantum Physics circles these days, but but its more traditional use here I think is more aprapos here than the meaning used by Quantum Physics. If you look it up there are a bunch of variations, but the ![Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/complementarity) says it best

complementarity
: the quality of being different but useful when combined

This, I think, is a great definition to use for the relationship between Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) and API security, and especially between !(Ap

## Complete code-to-runtime API discovery
With our deep code analysis, Apiiro continuously inventories all APIs and data models and audits all activity in repositories to detect new and material changes to APIs and surface weaknesses before they’re committed or deployed. Powered by our Risk Graph, Apiiro can also highlight APIs connected to sensitive data (i.e., PII, PCI, PHI) or other security weaknesses.

This level of code-based visibility and ability to discover API components vulnerable to misconfigurations, code logic flaws, design flaws, and common coding errors is an important complement to runtime API security.

Having code-to-runtime visibility of your API estate helps not only discover shadow APIs but also enables developers to prevent API weaknesses from being deployed, saving time spent reactively addressing risk. Apiiro’s proactive approach also helps modernize your risk assessment processes and proactively trigger security reviews based on risky material API changes in code.
## Prioritization of API risks in code with runtime context from Akamai 
Determining whether or not an API weakness in code is actually risky to your organization—and to what degree—depends on the likelihood (i.e., a risk in a publicly exposed API is more likely to manifest as a real risk) and impact (i.e., an API handling sensitive data has a greater potential impact) a risk has on your business. 
By connecting Apiiro’s deep contextual knowledge of code and insight into API behavior and threats in runtime from Akamai’s API Security, you can more accurately determine a risk’s likelihood and impact and prioritize business-critical API risks.
